# Kaggle_Digit_Recognizer
This is a Kaggle competition using the MNIST dataset of handwritten images of digits from 0 through 9. The goal of the competition is to correctly identify digits in the test data set. The training data contains 42,000 images of handwritten digits with labels and the test data contains 28,000 images without labels. The images in the data set are gray-scale images of hand-drawn digits where each pixel in the image has a single integer pixel-value associated with it ranging from 0 to 255, with higher values indicating darker pixels. Each image is 28 pixels in height and 28 pixels in width, for a total of 784 pixels in total.

To make predictions on the data set, we first remove the pixels which have zero variance to help reduce the dimensionality of the dataset. We then break down the remaining data into their principle components with PCA to further reduce the dimensionality of the dataset as we choose to use the first 75 moments. The result is then used to fit two different support vector machine models, one with a linear kernel and one with a 3rd polynomial kernel. We break up the training set in order to validate both models and we also do parameter tuning of the SVM parameters. On submission to Kaggle, the linear kernel SVM achieves an accuracy of 93.6% and the polynomial kernel achieves an accuracy of 98.2%.
